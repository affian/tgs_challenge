Kaggle TGS challenge approached using IBM PowerAi Vision detectron model

First, the kaggle data science approach is recreated to understand the process (mean IOU is the metric used), then the training data is uploaded to PAIV where it is annotated, trained and inferenced using the test data. This entire process took less than 24 hours in total as opposed to the countless man hours spent programming the kaggle model (I appreciate you, Data Scientists!), See result.png & result2.png.
